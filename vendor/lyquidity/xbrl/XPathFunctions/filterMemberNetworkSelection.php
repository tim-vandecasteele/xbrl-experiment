/**
 * Returns a sequence containing a selected set of dimension member QNames for the specified explicit dimension
 * considering only those members that have the specified relationship axis to the specified origin member in
 * the network of effective relationships with the specified link role for the specified arc role. The set of
 * dimension member QNames is in an arbitrary order (not necessarily that of effective tree relationships order).
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * Note that the relationships can be expressed by an arc element that conforms to the requirements set out in
 * the XBRL 2.1 specification. Importantly, the relationships do not have to be expressed by XBRL 2.1 definition
 * arc elements and they do not have to have arcroles defined in the XBRL Dimensions specification. Note that
 * if the QName given for the member argument is not a member of the relevant explicit dimension, the function
 * returns the empty sequence.
 *
 * @param XPath2Context $context
 * @param NodeProvider	$provider
 * @param array $args
 * @return xs:QName*	Returns a sequence which is the set of reportable dimension member QNames for the specified
 * 						explicit dimension per the inputs described above. (Note: the definition of a set requires
 * 						that it have distinct members.)
 *
 * @throw xfie:invalidDimensionQName	This error MUST be thrown if the dimension is not in the reference
 * 										discoverable taxonomy set.
 *
 * This function has one real argument:
 *
 * dimension	xs:QName	The QName of the dimension. This input is provided so that the function can check that the
 * 							members selected from the network are members of the dimension, and only return those that are.
 *
 * member		xs:QName	The QName of the dimension member that the selection criteria specified by the axis parameter
 * 							are going to be applied relative to.
 *
 * linkrole		xs:string	The linkrole value that specifies the network of effective relationships to determine the
 * 							selected members on the specified axis from the member used as the origin.
 *
 * arcrole		xs:string	The arcrole value that specifies the network of effective relationships as above.
 *
 * axis			xs:string	The axis value MUST be one of: descendant-or-self child-or-self descendant child
 *
 * 							If the axis value is 'child' then the result includes those domain members in the
 * 							explicit dimension domain that are targets of effective arcrole relationships from
 * 							the member identified by QName in the linkrole network.
 *
 * 							If the axis value is 'child-or-self' then the result includes the domain member identified
 * 							by the member QName and those domain members in the explicit dimension domain that are targets
 * 							of effective arcrole relationships from the domain member identified by QName value.
 *
 * 							If the axis value is 'descendant' then the filter-member set includes those domain members
 * 							in the explicit dimension domain that are descendants of the member QName, in the linkrole
 * 							network of arcrole effective relationships.
 *
 * 							If the axis value is 'descendant-or-self' then the filter-member set includes includes the
 * 							domain member identified by the member QName and those domain members in the explicit
 * 							dimension domain that are descendants of the member QName, in the linkrole network of
 * 							arcrole effective relationships.
