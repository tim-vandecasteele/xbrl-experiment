/**
 * Returns a sequence containing the set of the uncovered non-dimensional aspects for use in XPath expressions of a
 * consistency assertion, value assertion, formula aspect rule, or generic message XPath expression. The function is
 * not applicable to variable-set variable evaluation and filter expressions.
 *
 * @param XPath2Context $context
 * @param NodeProvider $provider
 * @param array $args
 * @return xs:token	Returns a sequence of the uncovered non-dimensional aspects for the aspect-model of the variable-set.
 * 					This sequence may include: concept entity-identifier location period unit complete-segment
 * 					(non-dimensional aspect model) complete-scenario (non-dimensional aspect model) non-XDT-segment
 * 					(dimensional aspect model) non-XDT-scenario (dimensional aspect model)
 * 					For dimensional aspects, given the dimensional aspect model, see the function
 * 					xff:uncovered-dimensional-aspects. The aspect model of the variable set determines the whether the
 * 					complete segment/scenario aspects, or the non-XDT-segment/scenario aspects may be returned by the
 * 					function results.
 * 					The order of uncovered aspects tokens is not specified and may not be consistent even for the same
 * 					fact set. (Note: the definition of a set requires that it have distinct members.) If all aspects are
 * 					covered, the output is an empty sequence.
 *
 * The function implemented by this function has no real arguments:
 *
 * variable	xs:QName	The variable to report on whether it has a fallback value.
 *
 * @throws xffe:invalidFunctionUse	This error MUST be thrown if the this function is referenced in an XPath expression
 * 									invoked in variable-set variable evaluation, such as by a generalVariable or filter
 * 									XPath expression. A formula processor MAY detect this error as a static compilation-time
 * 									error if it this function is referenced in variable-set variable evaluation expressions
 * 									(by generalVariable or filters).
 * 									A formula processor MUST detect this error as a dynamic run-time error if it this function
 * 									is referenced in variable-set variable evaluation expressions (by generalVariable or
 * 									filters), such as during execution of an XPath or other language implementation of custom
 * 									functions that were invoked dynamically in variable-set evaluation expressions (by
 * 									generalVariable or filters).
 * 									This error MUST be thrown if the this function is referenced in an XPath expression
 * 									invoked in an XPath function related to an existence assertion, including if referenced
 * 									in an XPath expression from generic messages relating to an existence assertion.
